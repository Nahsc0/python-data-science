# Heart Disease Prediction Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals using machine learning techniques. By analyzing various medical attributes, we develop a predictive model that helps identify potential cases of heart disease, enabling early intervention and treatment.

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease). It contains a comprehensive collection of medical attributes such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and electrocardiographic measurements. The dataset is available in CSV format and comprises both input features and target labels.

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/heart-disease-prediction.git
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage Instructions
1. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory to explore the data, preprocess it, and train the model using Jupyter notebooks.
2. Alternatively, use the scripts in the `src/` directory for data preprocessing and model training by running:
   ```
   python src/data_preprocessing.py
   python src/model.py
   ```

## Results and Evaluation
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 85% on the validation set. The ROC curve and confusion matrix can be visualized in the `results/` directory.
